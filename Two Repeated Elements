// You are given an array of N+2 integer elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to N. Also,
// all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.

Code: 

void main(){

// list of numbers to test the algorithim
 List<int> numbers = [1,2,1,3,4,3,5,5,2];
 
 // adds each number only once 
 List<int> nonRepeated = [];
 
 // if we tried to enter a number in nonRepeated that already exists there it'll be added here
 // it keeps track of duplicated Numbers
 List<int> repeated = [];
 
 for(int i = 0; i< numbers.length ; i++){
   if(nonRepeated.contains(numbers[i])){
     repeated.add(numbers[i]);
   }else{
     nonRepeated.add(numbers[i]);
   }
 }
 
 for(int i in repeated){
   print('$i');
 }
}


Expected : 1 3 5 2 , OutPut 1 3 5 2
